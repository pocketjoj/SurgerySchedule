Thank you for looking at my "Surgery Schedule" SQL project.

- You should be able to run this script in SQL Server (SSMS); it is re-runnable because I have "DROP" commands for table, procedure and indices. All of the query requirements start at line 775.

- The table/insert scripts stop at line 480. From line 480 - 775 is SQL commands to populate the "SurgerySchedule" table based off of the "ToBeScheduled" table. Some of the requirements are met within those lines, but that was an extra challenge (to auto-populate a Surgery Schedule) that I had for myself in this project.

Thanks again!
Joel
